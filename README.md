2. Organize the data flow using Redux.
3. Show photo thumbnails in the single screen. The screen should be responsive.
4. Allow the user to select a photo by pressing on it and then open a pop-up to show the photo with original size.
5. User can add a comment on a photo and edit or delete it later. User cannot delete other user’s comments.

# Bonus (optional)

1. Writing a couple of unit tests with the framework of your choice for the available features.
